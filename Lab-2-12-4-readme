1. No classes suggested (see Lab Work 2.12.4.Task) were taken to MyPhone.class as either nested or inner classes.
The reason for this is that the classes with prefix "My..." are commonly used to operate User Profile Data such as:
* User contacts (MyPhoneBook);
* User files (MyDocuments, MyPictures, MyDownloads ...)
* etc.

2. Since all of the listed classes (see Lab Work 2.12.4.Task) are implementing separate devices, they were added to project as top-level
classes.

3. Classes Battery.class and BatteryCharger.class were grouped in a non-static context while BatteryCharger.class needs "full
excess" to its outer class members. With reference to nested classes paradigm, BatteryCharger "cannot exist" without Battery as well.

4. Unlike Battery and BatteryCharger classes, Headphones class was nested to PhoneSpeaker as these two classes implement
two different devices but tend to share the same logic of sound stream playback, for instance.
